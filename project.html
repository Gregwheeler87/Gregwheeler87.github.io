     <!-- THE PROBLEM-->
     <section class="problem">
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>Cloud storage started out as a simple way to store files. Today most cloud storage applications come with the ability to store your photos, videos, pdfs, create documents, collaborate with others, etc. The increase in the amount of content you can store has brought a challenge of organizing the content in a way that makes sense. That’s where Shelf comes in.</p>
     </section>
     <!-- THE SOLUTION-->
     <section class="solution">
      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p id="solutiontext">A shelf is defined as a space where items can be stored or displayed. The concept is easy to understand as everyone has at least one shelf in their living space. Shelf makes it easy to organize all of the content that matters to you. You can have as many or as little shelves as you’d like. Inside of each shelf, you have albums where you can organize photos and videos and you have notebooks to write your latest blog post, journal your wildest dreams, or make your grocery list.</p>

           <p>The survey revealed some valuable insight into why users use cloud storage. This helped narrow down which of the 3 competitors matched up with the reasons they use cloud storage to really find some gaps to build a product that met users needs.</p>
           <h5>Below are my key discoveries:</h5>
           <ul class="bulletpoints">
             <li class="points"><strong>76%</strong> use Google as their cloud storage app</li>
             <li class="points"><strong>66%</strong> use Dropbox as their cloud storage app</li>
             <li class="points"><strong>83%</strong> use cloud storage to store photos, videos and pdfs</li>
             <li class="points"><strong>53%</strong> use it for creating notes and storing photos</li>
             <li class="points">The biggest frustration per the survey was not being able to understand it and the organization of files</li>
             <li class="points">For those who don’t use cloud storage, <strong>50%</strong> said it’s because it’s too complicated</li>

       <h3 class="mobilepadding">Prototype</h3>
       <p>One of the main user stories created was the ability to move items and organize items either by creating a new shelf or moving an item to a shelf within a notebook or album. It was important that these tasks were easy to perform as this was one of the frustrations revealed during the research phase.</p>

      <h3>User Testing</h3>
      <p>The prototype was tested in the low-fidelity and the hi-fidelity phase. The 3 main tasks during the tests where to: sign up for an account, add a photo, and move the most recent photo to an album. Below are my findings:</p>
       <section class="sign up for account">
         <h4>Sign up for an account</h4>
         <p class="insidetext">The sign up process was pretty intuitive for all the users. The call to action button sometimes was used and other times it was the “create account” button in the top right hand corner.</p>

       </section>
       <section class="add a photo">
         <h4>Add a Photo</h4>
         <p class="insidetext">The drop down menu caused confusion. Users weren’t sure what was clickable. The main issue here was spacing. In addtion to that, a blue rectangle was added around the item when you hovered over clickable items for more feedback.</p>

        </div>
       </section>
       <section class="move photo into album">
         <h4>Move a photo into an album</h4>
         <p class="insidetext">The “move” icon was not clear. Simply adding the word “move” under the icon made a much better experience. In addition to that, the initial design had the user click on a file to reveal options of moving the item to a shelf, album and or notebook. This proved to be unsuccessful as it wasn’t clear that the user needed to click on the file. The 2nd interation included the options when hovering over the image making this very easy to see how you can move an item. </p>

     <!-- Preference testing-->
     <section class="preference testing">
       <h3 class="mobilepadding">Preference Testing</h3>
        <section class="hero image">
          <h4>Hero Image</h4>
          <p class="insidetext">There were 2 different Hero images for the preference test. The results were at a 60/40 split. 60% liked the image of the kids playing while 40% liked the image of the bookshelf. Those who liked the image of the kids thought it went well with the tag line “Store and organize your favorite moments”. There were some comments though that had said the image with the kids didn’t communicate anything about “storing”. The image of the bookshelf doesn’t evoke emotion like the kids playing. Overall the image of kids playing evokes more emotion and ties in with the goal of the project which is to make it easy to organize content that is important.</p>
          <div class="heroimagegrid">
           <img src="Assets/Case Study/Heroimage1.png" alt="Hero Image 1">

        </section>
        <section class="search bar">
          <h4>Search Bar</h4>
          <p class="insidetext">This was between a design with a clear gray box around the word “search” or no box at all. The overall test results revealed the design with the light gray box was way easier to see and identify quickly. 100% of particpants chose the option with the gray box. The no box design made people have to think about it whereas the box made it easy to find.</p>

       <h3>Branding & Identity</h3>
       <p>Shelf was created to solve the problem of needing to easily organize your digital content in a fun and familiar way. So the branding needing to reflect a simple and clean approach to help communicate the message.</p>
        <section class="conceptual ideation">
          <h4>Conceptual Ideation</h4>
          <p class="insidetext">The conceptual ideation phase kicked off with a mind map which led to the idea of organizing using shelves.</p>

        <section class="logodesign">
          <h4>Logo Design</h4>
          <p class="insidetext">Sketches were done using some more abstract and literal ideas. </p>
          <img src="Assets/Case Study/logoideas.png" alt="Logo Ideas image">
          <p class="insidetext">The end result was a more abstract logo using the E as the shelf.</p>
          <img src="Assets/Case Study/Welcome to our brand.png" alt="Final Logo image">
          <p class="insidetext">To help communicate the fun aspect of Shelf, brighter and cheerful colors were used that went along with the background colors. The yellow brings out the fun and excitement while the blue balances it out with a color that communicates trust and stability to showcase the familiarity of a shelf.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="conclusiontext">The research confirmed the need for an application that met the need of organizing digital content for personal use.</p>
      <p class="conclusiontext">The survey helped idenitify the needs/frustrations of the user. Usability testing helped to see that what I thought made sense wasn’t always the case. It was the testing that brought that to light and helped to refine the app to make for a better experience.</p>
      <p class="conclusiontext">Overall, I believe this app is going to really be beneficial to those looking to have a way to organize all of their personal content. </p>
