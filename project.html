       <!-- THE PROBLEM-->
       <div class="problem">
         <h2>The Problem</h2>
         <p>Cloud storage started out as a simple way to store files. Today most cloud storage applications come with the ability to store your photos, videos, pdfs, create documents, collaborate with others, etc. The increase in the amount of content you can store has brought a challenge of organizing the content in a way that makes sense. That’s where Shelf comes in.</p>

       <!-- THE SOLUTION-->
       <div class="solution">
         <h2>The Solution</h2>
         <p>A shelf is defined as a space where items can be stored or displayed. The concept is easy to understand as everyone has at least one shelf in their living space. I took this concept and applied it to the cloud storage space. Shelf makes it easy to organize all of the content that matters to you. You can have as many or as little shelves as you’d like. Inside of each shelf, you have albums where you can organize photos and videos and you have notebooks to write your latest blog post, journal your wildest dreams, or make your grocery list.</p>

         <div class="competitive analysis">
           <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
           <p>I started my research by first doing some competitive analysis on 3 big competitors in the cloud storage space that both serve a unique but different purposes. The idea was to throw a wide net and then look for gaps where we could come in and help build an app that met unmet needs with these other competitors.</p>

         <!-- Survey-->
         <div class="Survey">
           <h3>Survey</h3>
           <p>The survey revealed some valuable insight into why users use cloud storage. This helped narrow down which of the 3 competitors I chose that matched up with why they use cloud storage to really find some gaps where I could build a product that met users needs.</p>
           <h5>Below are my key discoveries:</h5>
           <ul>
             <li>76% use Google as their cloud storage app</li>
             <li>66% use Dropbox as their cloud storage app</li>
             <li>83% use cloud storage to store photos, videos and pdfs</li>
             <li>53% use it for creating notes and storing photos</li>
             <li>The biggest frustration per the survey was not being able to understand it and the organization of files</li>
             <li>For those who don’t use cloud storage, 50% said it’s because it’s too complicated</li>
           </ul>
           <p>Overall, the data revealed cloud storage is mainly used to store photos and videos but can be complicated to navigate & organize. Based on this data, the personas I created needed to reflect the needs of an easy to understand cloud storage app and was easy to store your photos and videos.</p>

         <!-- Personas-->
         <div class="Personas">
           <h3>Personas</h3>
           <p>I needed to create personas who actively took photos/videos, who use cloud storage now and who have a desire to organize their life easily so they can continue focusing on what matters to them.</p>
