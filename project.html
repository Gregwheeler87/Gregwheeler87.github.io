     <!-- THE PROBLEM-->
     <section class="problem">
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>Cloud storage started out as a simple way to store files. Today most cloud storage applications come with the ability to store your photos, videos, pdfs, create documents, collaborate with others, etc. The increase in the amount of content you can store has brought a challenge of organizing the content in a way that makes sense. That’s where Shelf comes in.</p>
     </section>
     <!-- THE SOLUTION-->
     <section class="solution">
      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p>A shelf is defined as a space where items can be stored or displayed. The concept is easy to understand as everyone has at least one shelf in their living space. I took this concept and applied it to the cloud storage space. Shelf makes it easy to organize all of the content that matters to you. You can have as many or as little shelves as you’d like. Inside of each shelf, you have albums where you can organize photos and videos and you have notebooks to write your latest blog post, journal your wildest dreams, or make your grocery list.</p>

           <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
           <p>I started my research by first doing some competitive analysis on 3 big competitors in the cloud storage space that both serve a unique but different purposes. The idea was to throw a wide net and then look for gaps where we could come in and help build an app that met unmet needs with these other competitors.</p>

         <!-- Survey-->
         <section class="Survey">
           <h3>Survey</h3>
           <p>The survey revealed some valuable insight into why users use cloud storage. This helped narrow down which of the 3 competitors I chose that matched up with why they use cloud storage to really find some gaps where I could build a product that met users needs.</p>
           <h5>Below are my key discoveries:</h5>
           <ul>
             <li>76% use Google as their cloud storage app</li>
             <li>66% use Dropbox as their cloud storage app</li>
             <li>83% use cloud storage to store photos, videos and pdfs</li>
             <li>53% use it for creating notes and storing photos</li>
             <li>The biggest frustration per the survey was not being able to understand it and the organization of files</li>
             <li>For those who don’t use cloud storage, 50% said it’s because it’s too complicated</li>
           </ul>
           <p>Overall, the data revealed cloud storage is mainly used to store photos and videos but can be complicated to navigate & organize. Based on this data, the personas I created needed to reflect the needs of an easy to understand cloud storage app and was easy to store your photos and videos.</p>

          <p>After nailing down the goals, motivations, frustrations and basic lifestyle of the targeted users, it was now time to write some user stories/user flows that solved our users problems.</p>
     </section>
     <!-- USER STORIES/FLOWS-->
     <section class="User Stories/flows">
       <h3>User Stories/Flows</h3>
       <p>I created user stories to highlight the main features of the product. The user stories were then converted into User flows done in Draw.io, to illustrate how the user would interact with the product and accomplish those goals.</p>

       <p>One of the user stories I needed to design was the ability to move items and organize items either by creating a new shelf or moving an item to a shelf within a notebook or album. It was important that I made these tasks easy to perform as this was one of the big issues we saw during the research phase.</p>

     <section class="User Testing">
      <h3>User Testing</h3>
      <p>I tested the prototype in the low-fidelity phase and the hi-fidelity phase. The 3 main tasks during the tests where to: sign up for an account, add a photo, and move the most recent photo to an album. Here’s what I learned:</p>
       <section class="Sign up for account">
         <h4>Sign up for an account</h4>
         <p>The sign up process was pretty intuitive for all the users. The call to action button sometimes was used and other times it was the “create account” button in the top right hand corner.</p>

       <section class="Add a photo">
         <h4>Add a Photo</h4>
         <p>The drop down menu caused confusion. Users weren’t sure what was clickable. The main issue here was spacing. I also added a blue rectangle around the item when you hovered over clickable items.</p>

         <img src="assets/case study/click new drop down 2.png" alt="Mockup image">
       </section>
       <section class="move photo into album">
         <h4>Move a photo into an album</h4>
         <p>The “move” icon was not clear. Simply adding the word “move” under the icon made a much better experience. In addition to that, the initial design had the user click on a file to reveal options of moving the item to a shelf, album and or notebook. This proved to be unsuccessful as it wasn’t clear that the user needed to click on the file. Our 2nd interation included the options when hovering over the image making this very easy to see how you can move an item. </p>

          <h4>Hero Image</h4>
          <p>I had 2 different Hero images for the preference test. The results were at a 60/40 split. 60% liked the image of the kids playing while 40% liked the image of the bookshelf. Those who liked the image of the kids thought it went well with the tag line “Store and organize your favorite moments”. There were some comments though that had said the image with the kids didn’t communicate anything about “storing” which I thought was a good point. The image of the bookshelf doesn’t evoke emotion like the kids playing. Overall I believe the kids playing evokes more emotion and goes with the branding.</p>

        <section class="Search Bar">
          <h4>Search Bar</h4>
          <p>This was between a design with a clear gray box around the word “search” or no box at all. The overall test results revealed the design with the light gray box was way easier to see and identify quickly. 100% of particpants chose the option with the gray box. While I actually liked the no box design, it made people have to think about it whereas the box made it easy to find.</p>

       <h3>Branding & Identity</h3>
       <p>Shelf was created to solve the problem of needing to easily organize your digital content in a fun and familiar way. So the branding needing to reflect a simple and clean approach to help communicate the message.</p>

          <h4>Conceptual Ideation</h4>
          <p>I started off with brainstorming with the words cloud storage which led me to the idea of organizing using shelves.</p>

          <h4>Logo Design</h4>
          <p>I started with some sketches using some more abstract and literal ideas. </p>

          <p>The end result was a more abstract logo using the E as the shelf.</p>

          <p>To help communicate the fun aspect of Shelf, I wanted to use brighter and cheerful colors that went along with the background colors I chose. The yellow brings out the fun and excitement while the blue balances it out with a color that communicates trust and stability to showcase the familiarity of a shelf.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>My initial thought coming into this project was that the space was already overly saturated and there wasn’t going to be a problem that already hasn’t been solved. But, the research confirmed the need for an application that met the need of organizing digital content for personal use.</p>
      <p>The two big suprises and most helpful in designing this app was the survey/competitive analysis and the usability testing. The survey helped idenitify the needs/frustrations of the user. Usability testing helped me to see that what I thought made sense wasn’t always the case. It was the testing that brought that to light and helped me to refine the app to make for a better experience.</p>
      <p>Overall, I believe this app is going to really be benefical to those looking to have a way to organize all of their personal content. </p>
