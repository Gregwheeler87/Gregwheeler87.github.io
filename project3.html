     <section class="problem">
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>Mom & Dad already have enough on their mind with work, making sure the house is kept up, kid’s soccer games, asking 5 million times if homework is done, paying the bills and this is just the tip of the iceberg. The last thing they want to take time to consider after a full day is “what’s for dinner?”.</p>

     <section class="solution">
      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p id="solutiontext">MealEasy eliminates “what’s for dinner” so families can focus on what matters. It’s a clean and easy-to-use app to plan meals and shop in one quick trip for the week. Gone are the last minute trips to the store and the ever-nagging question “where’s that recipe”? Let’s dive into story of MealEasy.</p>

      <!-- Survey-->
      <section class="survey">
        <h3 class="mobilepadding">Survey</h3>
        <p>After surveying busy families from all walks of life, there was one thing in common. It was the amount of time spent on the process of planning meals for the week. </p>
        <h5>Below are my key discoveries:</h5>
        <ul class="bulletpoints">
          <li class="points">Most people cook 3-4 times a week</li>
          <li class="points"><strong>70%</strong> of people use paper to create their grocery list. Of the 70%, <strong>87.5%</strong> said they would use an app if it was as easy as using paper</li>
          <li class="points">Users want the grocery list categories to closely match the store layout </li>
          <li class="points">Nearly <strong>90%</strong> of the users say they would rather cook a recipe they already like than try a new one</li>
          <li class="points">2 of the most important factors when choosing what to eat are cook/prep time and amount of food it will make </li>
        </ul>

        <p>All of these discoveries lead to the amount of time it takes to accomplish these tasks. So the goal with this app was simple: reduce the amount of time.</p>

          <p> There were a few opportunites found.</p>
          <p> First was the ability to easily import a recipe vs providing recipes. This was a big one because as stated in the survey nearly 90% of people wanted to cook a recipe they already were familiar with not a new one. </p>
          <p> Second, because of the nature of meal planning apps, they were crawling with features which led to frustration due to the amount of time it takes to learn the app. This was an opportunity MealEasy could help with.</p>

       <p id="wireframetext">I started with lo-fi wireframes to get a feel for where the content would go and how that affected the user flows I created previously. Then it was on to the hi-fi wireframes with the copy I created in the content strategy. This helped me to really see how the layout from the lo-fi wireframes supported the copy. A few iterations that came about this journey.</p>
       <ul class="wireframesgrid">
         <p>On the intro screens, I realized I didn’t show the progress or how long the intro screens would take or give them the option to skip it. To solve that I included 3 dots with one circled in representing which screen you were on. I also included a skip button in the top right corner.</p>
         <img id="wfimage" src="Assets/Meal Planner App/wf1.png" alt="Wireframes Image">
         <p>The “meet app screen” with the 3 steps was seen as confusing because the 3 steps were housed in button style rectangles. To resolve this I removed the rectangles and added small circles around the numbers.</p>

     <!-- High-fidelity Mockups-->
     <section class="hfmockups">
       <h3>High-Fidelity Mockups</h3>
       <p>The app itself has a quite a few things going on. You have 3 big features of adding recipes, a grocery list and a meal planner all in one app. So naturally the scope of this app could easily have gone out of control. What helped was continuing to ask the questions, does this decision make it more simple, easy or convenient? If not, it needed to go. During the mockups phase a few things came up.</p>
       <ul class="mockupsgrid">
         <p>The meal planner screen was minimalstic but it didn’t communicate “wow” visually. This was important as it was the first screen the user interacted after going through the intro screens. To solve that, I created a screen with small cards. It still was very simple but was more visually appealing.</p>

         <p>On the recipe screen I included a CTA at the bottom of the screen. It was easily identifyable with no recipes loaded but as more recipes were added, the question soon became would this button be seen anymore? To solve that I added a plus sign in the top right corner.</p>

      <h3>User Testing</h3>
      <p>The 3 main tasks during the tests where to: add a new recipe, schedule a meal on the meal plan screen, check off an item on the grocery list and remove the loaded meal from the meal plan. Below are my findings:</p>
       <section class="sign up for account">
         <h4>Onboarding screens</h4>
         <p class="insidetext">The progress dots on the bottom made users think the screens were swipeable. The solution here was to allow user to swipe in addition to using the button.</p>

         <h4>Meal plan card style</h4>
         <p class="insidetext">Once the meal was loaded in the meal plan screen, the user thought they lost the date. The placement of the date at the bottom made it harder to identify. The solution here was to swap the title of the recipe and the date.

         <h4>The pencil icon was too small</h4>
         <p class="insidetext">All users used the edit pencil to remove. The process was very smooth. No friction here. The only thing I noticed was one of the users asked if it was a pencil making me think the pencil was a little too small. The solution was to increase the size of the pencil icon. </p>

        <section class="hero image">
          <h4>Hero Image</h4>
          <p class="insidetext">There were 2 different Hero images for the preference test. The results were at a 60/40 split. 60% liked the image of the kids playing while 40% liked the image of the bookshelf. Those who liked the image of the kids thought it went well with the tag line “Store and organize your favorite moments”. There were some comments though that had said the image with the kids didn’t communicate anything about “storing”. The image of the bookshelf doesn’t evoke emotion like the kids playing. Overall the image of kids playing evokes more emotion and ties in with the goal of the project which is to make it easy to organize content that is important.</p>

          <h4>Search Bar</h4>
          <p class="insidetext">This was between a design with a clear gray box around the word “search” or no box at all. The overall test results revealed the design with the light gray box was way easier to see and identify quickly. 100% of particpants chose the option with the gray box. The no box design made people have to think about it whereas the box made it easy to find.</p>

       <h3>Branding & Identity</h3>
       <p>It started with list-making with the words simple and meal-planning. This led to identifying 3 words that would be a filter for all design decisions. The 3 words were: Simple, Easy & Convenient. Everything from color, typography, button design to copy needed to go through these 3 words. </p>

          <h4>Logo Design</h4>
          <p class="insidetext">The sketches of the logo were both from an abstract to a more literal feel. Keeping the words simple, easy & convenient in mind, it made sense to go with a minimalistic logo. </p>

          <p class="insidetext">To keep it simple with typography I went with one font: open sans. The font is a modern sans serif font with quite a few weight options to help communicate throughout the app. </p>

          <p class="insidetext">The colors needed to support the minimalstic approach. In addition, the accent color purple helps the food/grocery app stand out as most of the food apps are red, orange or green. </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="conclusiontext">The overall challenge here was designing a beefy (pun intended) meal planning app that was also simple, easy and convenient to use.
</p>
      <p class="conclusiontext">Idenfiying the pain points and ultimately realizing that the time spent on planning, shopping and cooking was the one thing that needed to be reduced provided clarity along the journey.</p>
      <p class="conclusiontext">Throughout the process it was important for me to continue to ask does this solve the problem? Does it support the overall goal of saving time? After many iterations and testing I believe this is a great start to a meal planning app that busy families will love. </p>
